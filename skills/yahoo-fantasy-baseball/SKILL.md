# Yahoo Fantasy Baseball

Manage your Yahoo Fantasy Baseball league: view data, optimize your daily lineup, and execute roster changes via the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- `yahoo_fantasy_api` — Yahoo Fantasy Sports API wrapper

**Installation:** No manual `pip install` needed. On first run, `yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py` creates a local `.deps/` virtual environment inside the skill directory and installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`. Subsequent runs reuse the existing venv. To force a clean reinstall, delete the `.deps/` directory and run any command again.

## Setup

### 1. Create a Yahoo Developer App

1. Go to [https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/)
2. Click "Create an App"
3. Set **Redirect URI** to `oob` (out-of-band — Yahoo displays the auth code on screen instead of redirecting to a URL)
4. Copy the **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**

### 2. Authenticate

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py auth
```

Follow the prompts to enter your Consumer Key and Secret. A browser window opens for Yahoo OAuth authorization. Tokens are cached automatically — you only need to do this once.

### 3. Find Your League

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py leagues
```

### 4. Set Defaults

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py config --league 12345
```

The skill auto-detects your team within the league. You can also set it explicitly:

```bash
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py config --league 12345 --team 3
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# View your roster
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py roster

# Daily roster status (who's playing, who's off)
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py today

# Roster status for a specific date
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py day --date 2026-03-25

# Players & Draft
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py players [--search NAME] [--position POS] [--status FA|A|T|W|ALL] [--sort OR|AR|PTS|NAME|HR|ERA|...] [--sort-type season|lastweek|lastmonth] [--stat-season YEAR] [--count N]
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py draft [--team ID]

```

### Daily Management

```bash
# Today: roster status with MLB schedule awareness (shortcut for 'day' with today's date)
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py today

# Day: roster status for a specific date
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py day --date 2026-03-25
```

Groups your roster into ACTIVE (team playing), NOT PLAYING (team off), INJURED, and BENCH. Shows each player's eligible positions, game start times (local timezone), and flags probable starting pitchers. Displays "First pitch" time at the top so you know when to finalize your lineup. The `today` command is a shortcut for `day` with today's date.

```bash
# Standouts: yesterday's top performers across all league teams
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py standouts [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--min-points N] [--count N]
```

Fetches daily player stats for all rostered players across every team in the league and identifies standout performances. Output is split into two sections:
1. **Top Performers** — players in active lineup slots who scored the most fantasy points
2. **Left on the Bench** — benched players with notable performances (points that didn't count)

Each player shows their fantasy points, key stat line, and achievement badges (e.g., "Multi-HR", "10+ K", "Gem", "CGSO"). Defaults to yesterday; use `--date` for a specific date.

```bash
# Optimize: smart roster analysis with suggestions
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py optimize
```

Three analysis categories:
1. **Lineup swaps** — optimal batter assignment via constraint solver (position-aware, fills restrictive slots before UTIL)
2. **Pitcher rotation** — probable starters on bench, active pitchers on off days
3. **IL management** — injured players not in IL slots, cleared players still in IL

### Write Commands

All write commands show a preview by default. Add `--confirm` to execute.

```bash
# Swap a player to a different position slot
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py swap --player "Aaron Judge" --to BN [--confirm]

# Auto-execute all optimize swap suggestions
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py swap --auto [--confirm]

python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py move-to-il --player "Zack Wheeler" [--confirm]

# Add a free agent

# Waiver claim (with optional FAAB bid and drop)
python3 /home/claw/.openclaw/workspace/skills/yahoo-fantasy-baseball/yahoo-fantasy-baseball.py claim --player "Jake Burger" [--drop "Luis Arraez"] [--faab 15] [--confirm]

### JSON

All commands support `--format json` for structured output.

### Discord

All commands support `--format discord` which wraps text output in code blocks.

## Output Fields

- **name** — Player's full name
- **player_id** — Yahoo player ID (numeric)
- **positions** — Eligible fantasy positions (e.g., OF, SP, Util)
- **selected_position** — Current lineup slot
- **team** — Real MLB team abbreviation
- **status** — Injury designation (IL, IL-60, DTD, etc.)
- **game_time** — Game start time in local timezone (today/day commands)
- **first_pitch** — Earliest game start time across all games (today/day commands, JSON top-level)
- **percent_owned** — Ownership percentage (free agents)
- **player_position** — Display position (draft results)

## Limitations

- **Rate limits**: Yahoo enforces API rate limits. Avoid rapid-fire requests.
- **Season scope**: Data is scoped to the configured season. Use `--season` for historical data.
- **OAuth tokens**: Tokens auto-refresh but may eventually expire, requiring re-authentication via `auth`.
- **MLB schedule**: The `today`, `day`, and `optimize` commands use the MLB Stats API for schedule data (off days, probable pitchers). This data is not available from the Yahoo Fantasy API.

## Credential Storage

Credentials are stored in `~/.openclaw/credentials/yahoo-fantasy/`:
- `oauth2.json` — OAuth consumer key/secret and tokens (managed by yahoo_oauth)
- `yahoo-fantasy.json` — Default league_id, team_id, season

Legacy YFPY `.env` credentials are auto-migrated to `oauth2.json` on first use.

## Notes

- Data is sourced from the Yahoo Fantasy Sports API via the [yahoo-fantasy-api](https://github.com/spilchen/yahoo_fantasy_api) library.
- MLB schedule and probable pitcher data comes from the [MLB Stats API](https://statsapi.mlb.com/) (stdlib only, no dependencies).
- On first run, a local venv is created at `.deps/` and dependencies are installed automatically.
- Auto-detect identifies your team using `league.team_key()`. If detection fails, use `config --team <ID>` to set it manually.
- Write operations always preview changes before executing. Use `--confirm` to apply changes.
