## 0. Active Architecture Initiative — ARCH-001 (Phase 1 COMPLETE, Phase 2 COMPLETE, Phase 3 COMPLETE)

### What Was Built This Session (March 31)

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `backend/contracts.py` | ✅ LIVE | Three immutable Pydantic contracts: LineupOptimizationRequest, PlayerValuationReport, ExecutionDecision |
| `scripts/migrate_v11_job_queue.py` | ✅ RAN ON RAILWAY | Creates job_queue + execution_decisions tables |
| `backend/services/job_queue_service.py` | ✅ LIVE | Submit/poll/process jobs. SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED. asyncio.to_thread dispatch. |
| `backend/main.py` | ✅ WIRED | job_queue_processor job (5s interval) + POST /api/fantasy/lineup/async-optimize + GET /api/fantasy/jobs/{job_id} |
| `scripts/migrate_v12_valuation_cache.py` | ✅ READY | Creates player_valuation_cache table. Run on Railway before next deploy. |
| `backend/models.py` | ✅ EXTENDED | PlayerValuationCache ORM class added |
| `backend/fantasy_baseball/valuation_worker.py` | ✅ LIVE | run_valuation_worker(league_key) — 6 AM ET, Yahoo + Statcast, soft-delete upsert |
| `backend/services/daily_ingestion.py` | ✅ EXTENDED | valuation_cache job at 06:00 ET, advisory lock 100_011, gated on FANTASY_LEAGUES env var |
| `backend/main.py` | ✅ EXTENDED | GET /api/fantasy/players/valuations — exact-date + 7-day stale fallback, never 500 |

### CRITICAL: Run Migration Before Next Deploy
```bash
# Railway production — v12 must run before valuation_worker fires at 6 AM
railway run python scripts/migrate_v12_valuation_cache.py --dry-run
# Confirm SQL looks correct, then:
railway run python scripts/migrate_v12_valuation_cache.py

# Also set env var so the 6 AM job activates:
# railway variables set FANTASY_LEAGUES=<your_league_key>
```

### Phase 2 — COMPLETE
- `player_valuation_cache` table stores pre-computed `PlayerValuationReport` per player per day
- Worker runs at 6 AM ET (gated on `FANTASY_LEAGUES` env var)
- API endpoint degrades to stale data on cache miss — never breaks the page
- All syntax checks pass

---

### Phase 3 — COMPLETE: Frontend Integration (Wire Frontend to Async Backend)

**Goal achieved:** Lineup page no longer blocks on optimization. Async job + polling replaces the sync 10-30s call.

#### Phase 3a: Lineup page reads from valuation cache

**File:** `frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/lineup/page.tsx`

Current problem: lineup page calls backend which hits Yahoo + Statcast synchronously on every page load.

Required change:
- Add a call to `GET /api/fantasy/players/valuations?date=<today>&league_key=<key>` on page mount
- Display `cache_status` banner: "Live" (fresh), "Cached from {date}" (stale), "No projections yet" (empty)
- Player rows should read `composite_value.point_estimate` from the cached report for the projected value column
- Stale/empty cache = show data with a visual indicator, never an error page
- Remove any blocking direct Statcast/pybaseball calls from the page load path

#### Phase 3b: Lineup optimization goes async (non-blocking submit)

**File:** `frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/lineup/page.tsx`

Current problem: "Apply Lineup" button triggers a synchronous optimize + set call that can take 10-30s, causing connection drops.

Required change — replace the sync call with job submission + polling:

```
User clicks "Optimize" →
  POST /api/fantasy/lineup/async-optimize
  Returns: { job_id, status: "queued", poll_url }
  ↓
UI shows progress spinner with status text ("Queued → Processing → Complete")
  ↓
Poll GET /api/fantasy/jobs/{job_id} every 2s (max 60s timeout)
  ↓
On status="completed": show new lineup, enable "Apply" button
On status="failed": show error message from result.error field
On timeout: show "Taking longer than expected — check back in a minute"
```

Polling logic (TypeScript sketch):
```typescript
async function pollJob(jobId: string, maxAttempts = 30): Promise<JobResult> {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxAttempts; i++) {
    await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 2000))
    const res = await fetch(`/api/fantasy/jobs/${jobId}`)
    const data = await res.json()
    if (data.status === 'completed') return data
    if (data.status === 'failed') throw new Error(data.error || 'Job failed')
  }
  throw new Error('Timeout — job still running')
}
```

#### Phase 3c: Loading skeletons and error boundaries

**Files:** lineup page + shared components

- Add `<Skeleton>` component (shadcn/ui already installed) for player rows during initial load
- Wrap the entire lineup section in an `<ErrorBoundary>` with a "Reload" fallback — prevents one bad player from crashing the whole page
- Loading state: show skeleton rows while valuations endpoint is in-flight
- Error state: show "Projections unavailable — lineup optimization still works" (never blank page)

#### Phase 3 — Files to Touch

| File | Change | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| `frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/lineup/page.tsx` | Read valuations cache, async optimize polling | Medium — main lineup page |
| `frontend/components/ui/skeleton.tsx` | Create if not exists (shadcn pattern) | Low |
| `frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/lineup/page.tsx` | Error boundary wrapper | Low |

**Phase 3 implementation complete. TypeScript type-check passes.**

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `frontend/lib/types.ts` | Added `ValuationReport`, `ValuationsResponse`, `AsyncJobStatus` |
| `frontend/lib/api.ts` | Added `asyncOptimizeLineup`, `getJobStatus`, `getPlayerValuations` endpoints |
| `frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/lineup/page.tsx` | Phase 3a cache banner + Proj column; Phase 3b async optimize + poll loop; Phase 3c `LineupErrorBoundary` class |

---

### Architecture Rule (ADR-005 — LOCKED)
**All heavy operations MUST go through job_queue_service. Never run synchronously in the HTTP request path.**
Heavy = Yahoo API calls, Statcast ingestion, lineup optimization, MCMC simulation.

---

## 0b. Gemini UI Exploration — Forward-Looking (Non-Breaking)

Gemini CLI has demonstrated strong UI capability. Proposed forward-looking delegation:

**Scope (read-only first):** Gemini reads the Next.js frontend (`frontend/`) and produces a UI audit report identifying:
- Components that block on API calls without loading states
- Missing error boundaries
- Hardcoded strings that should be dynamic

**Gate before Gemini writes any frontend code:**
1. Claude Code must review and approve the audit
2. Changes must be non-breaking (no routing changes, no API contract changes)
3. All frontend changes go through the same spec-review process as backend

**This is exploratory — no Gemini frontend code until Claude approves the audit.**

---

## 0c. REVIEW TASK: Gemini CLI MCP Integration — Claude Code Determination Required

**Status:** Analysis complete, pending Claude Code decision  
**Reference:** `reports/GEMINI_MCP_ANALYSIS.md` (full assessment)  
**Source:** https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/

### Analysis Summary

Analyzed Gemini CLI's MCP (Model Context Protocol) server capabilities for potential operational efficiency gains. MCP would allow Gemini CLI to discover and execute custom tools (e.g., `railway_health_check`, `validate_deploy_ready`) through a standardized protocol.

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Implementation effort** | 3-4 days |
| **Time savings** | ~3 hours/month |
| **ROI break-even** | ~8 months |
| **Policy risk** | HIGH — must avoid EMAC-075 violations |

### Policy Constraint (Critical)

Per AGENTS.md §2, Gemini CLI is **HARD RESTRICTED** from code writes (EMAC-075). Any MCP tools must be strictly scoped to:
- ✅ Read-only operations (logs, health checks, report queries)
- ✅ Railway DevOps (deploy, env var checks)
- ✅ Pre-approved script execution
- ❌ NO code generation
- ❌ NO file modification
- ❌ NO database writes

### Review Task for Claude Code

**ULTIMATE DETERMINATION:** Claude Code must decide whether to implement Gemini MCP integration.

**Considerations:**
1. Current AGENTS.md workflow is functional but manual
2. MCP adds infrastructure complexity (additional process to maintain)
3. EMAC-075 requires strict tool auditing to prevent indirect code modification
4. MLB season is active — infrastructure changes carry risk
5. Alternative: Claude Code MCP (not Gemini) may offer higher value with no policy conflicts

**If Approved, Scope Strictly To:**
- `railway_health_check` — Comprehensive Railway status
- `validate_deploy_ready` — Pre-deployment validation (py_compile, env check)
- `query_reports` — Read-only access to `reports/` directory
- All tools with `trust: false` (require confirmation)

**Timing Recommendation:** Defer until post-MLB season (October 2026) unless operational pain becomes critical.

**Decision: DEFER — post-MLB season (October 2026)**

Rationale: 8-month ROI break-even, EMAC-075 policy scope requires careful auditing, MLB season active (minimize infra changes), current manual workflow is functional and compliant. Re-evaluate October 2026 when season concludes. No action this session.

## 1. Data Provider Strategy — LOCKED DECISIONS

### SUBSCRIPTIONS

| Provider | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| **BallDontLie GOAT (NCAAB)** | ❌ CANCELLED | CBB season is over. Do NOT renew. |
| **OddsAPI Champion** | ⏳ CANCEL AFTER APR 7 | Still needed for CBB tournament. Cancel once bracket concludes. |
| **BallDontLie GOAT (MLB)** | ✅ SUBSCRIBE AFTER APR 7 | Replaces OddsAPI for all MLB use cases. $39.99/mo. |

**Net cost after transition: $39.99/mo (down from $49/mo OddsAPI Champion). Saves ~$108/yr.**

---

### WHY BALLDONTLIE FOR MLB (not OddsAPI)

1. **Unified stats + odds in one API** — eliminates the raw OddsAPI call in `mlb_analysis._fetch_mlb_odds()` and the raw call in `daily_ingestion._poll_mlb_odds()`. Both are currently unabstracted stubs with no circuit breaker.
2. **Webhooks** — 125+ MLB event types. Enables live game events for betting timing without polling.
3. **600 req/min rate limit** — vs OddsAPI's 90,000/month call budget (polling only).
4. **MCP server** — 250+ endpoints compatible with Claude Code agent workflows.
5. **Bookmaker coverage tradeoff** — BDL covers ~15-20 books vs OddsAPI's 40+. Pinnacle IS included (confirmed in `balldontlie.py` `PREFERRED_BOOKS`). Sharp consensus logic is preserved.

### WHY KEEP PYBASEBALL / STATCAST (do not replace with BDL)

BallDontLie does not expose Statcast-tier metrics: **xwOBA, barrel%, exit velocity, hard-hit%**. These are the core of the fantasy projection engine (`statcast_ingestion.py`, `pybaseball_loader.py`). Keep pybaseball for Statcast. Add BDL for:
- Real-time injury feed
- Box scores (live game data)
- Live event webhooks for betting triggers

---

## 2. Implementation Plan — Post-Apr 7

### Phase 1: Cancel OddsAPI, Subscribe BDL GOAT (MLB) — Day 1 after tournament

**Manual steps (human action required):**
1. Cancel OddsAPI Champion subscription.
2. Subscribe to BallDontLie GOAT ($39.99/mo).
3. Set `BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY` env var in Railway (already present — update to MLB-tier key if different).
4. Remove `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` from Railway env after confirming no CBB code paths call it.

### Phase 2: Expand `balldontlie.py` for MLB — Claude Code task

**File:** `backend/services/balldontlie.py`

Current state: NCAAB-only (`/ncaab/v1/` prefix, TOURNAMENT_SEASON = 2025).

Required additions:
- Add `MLB_PREFIX = "/mlb/v1"` constant alongside `NCAAB_PREFIX`
- Add `get_mlb_games(date)` — fetch today's schedule
- Add `get_mlb_odds(date)` — fetch moneyline/runline/totals per game
- Add `get_mlb_player_stats(season, player_ids)` — season batting/pitching stats
- Add `get_mlb_injuries()` — active IL list
- Add `get_mlb_box_score(game_id)` — live/final box score

The existing client structure (session headers, `_get()`, `_paginate()`, circuit breaker pattern) is solid — replicate it for MLB endpoints. Do NOT break the existing NCAAB methods.

### Phase 3: Migrate MLB Odds Callers — Claude Code task

**Two dirty raw-OddsAPI callers to fix:**

| File | Method | Current Problem | Fix |
|------|--------|-----------------|-----|
| `backend/services/mlb_analysis.py` | `_fetch_mlb_odds()` | Raw `requests.get` to OddsAPI, no circuit breaker, no sharp consensus logic | Replace with `get_bdl_client().get_mlb_odds(date)` |
| `backend/services/daily_ingestion.py` | `_poll_mlb_odds()` | Same — raw OddsAPI call, not using `OddsAPIClient` | Replace with BDL call; preserve advisory lock pattern |

Both callers already have graceful degradation (`return {}` / `return {"status": "skipped"}` on failure), so the swap is low-risk.

### Phase 4: Add BDL as Fantasy Enrichment Feed — Claude Code task

**Not a replacement — additive only.** Existing pybaseball/Statcast pipeline stays untouched.

Add to `daily_ingestion.py` scheduler:
- `_poll_mlb_injuries()` job — calls `get_mlb_injuries()`, writes to a new `PlayerInjuryStatus` table or updates `PlayerDailyMetric.injury_status`
- `_ingest_mlb_box_scores()` job — post-game box scores for rolling stat updates

This feeds the fantasy dashboard's injury display (currently sourced from Yahoo only, which lags by hours).

## 3. Current Technical State

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **DB Migrations v9/v10** | ✅ LIVE | Chained into Dockerfile CMD; `user_preferences` table confirmed present |
| **Yahoo client** | ✅ CONSOLIDATED | Single file: `yahoo_client_resilient.py`. Base class + resilient layer unified. |
| **Roster endpoint (`/api/fantasy/roster`)** | ✅ LIVE | 200 OK. |
| **Matchup endpoint (`/api/fantasy/matchup`)** | ✅ LIVE | Team mapping fixed. |
| **SSE stream (`/api/fantasy/dashboard/stream`)** | ✅ LIVE | `StreamingResponse`, `text/event-stream`, 60s interval. No `sse-starlette` dep. |
| **Matchup enrichment** | ✅ LIVE | `opponent_record` from standings. `*_projected_categories` from `PlayerDailyMetric`. |
| **CircuitBreaker** | ✅ FIXED | Catches `Exception` (not just `expected_exception`) so all error types trip the breaker. |
| **Weather integration** | ✅ LIVE | Provider: OpenWeatherMap (`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` set). |
| **OR-Tools (Railway)** | ✅ LIVE | Installed via requirements.txt. |
| **Streamlit** | ✅ RETIRED | `dashboard/` untouched. Next.js is canonical UI. |
| **Test suite** | ✅ STABLE | 1199+ pass. |
| **RP-as-SP bug** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 29) | `pitcher_slot == "SP"` guard in `_get_probable_pitchers`. |
| **Yahoo stat category IDs** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 29) | `_YAHOO_STAT_FALLBACK` dict + all 22 frontend `STAT_LABELS`. |
| **UAT P0: No-game START** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | Post-optimizer override loop demotes `START` → `BENCH` when `opponent` is empty. |
| **UAT P1: SP score 0.000** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | `p.sp_score === 0 ? '—' : p.sp_score.toFixed(3)` in lineup page. |
| **UAT P1: UNKNOWN badge** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | `FALLBACK_LABELS` map in `statusBadge()` — UNKNOWN/NO_START → "NO START", RP → "RELIEVER". |
| **UAT P1: Streamlit sidebar link** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | Removed `localhost:8501` link from `sidebar.tsx` (Streamlit retired). |
| **UAT P1: Raw Pydantic errors** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | Warning banner filters `validation error` / `Traceback` strings. |
| **UAT: Global "Dashboard" header** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | Fantasy routes added to `PAGE_TITLES` in `header.tsx`. |
| **UAT: "Invalid Date ET"** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | Null guard on `dashboard.timestamp` in dashboard page. |
| **Yahoo flatten_entry last-wins bug** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | `if not stats_raw:` guard in `flatten_entry` — takes only first `team_stats` block. |
| **`_injury_lookup` bool crash** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | `isinstance(p.get("status"), str)` guard — rejects Yahoo `status: False/True`. |
| **`fetch_mlb_odds` coverage logging** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 30) | Logs game list + warns on 0-game response for Railway diagnostics. |
| **MCMC Simulator** | ✅ LIVE (Mar 30) | Calibrated and wired into `_get_matchup_preview()`. New `mcmc_calibration.py` converts Yahoo rosters to MCMC format using player_board + PlayerDailyMetric z-scores. Returns win_probability + category advantages/disadvantages.
| **CBB V9.2 recalibration** | ⏸ BLOCKED | EMAC-068 — SNR/integrity scalar stacking correction. Do NOT touch Kelly math until Apr 7. |
| **`balldontlie.py`** | ⚠️ NCAAB-ONLY | Needs MLB endpoint expansion post-Apr 7 (see §2 Phase 2). |
| **`mlb_analysis._fetch_mlb_odds()`** | ⚠️ DIRTY | Raw OddsAPI call — no circuit breaker, no abstraction. Migrate to BDL post-Apr 7. |
| **`daily_ingestion._poll_mlb_odds()`** | ⚠️ DIRTY | Same — raw OddsAPI call. Migrate to BDL post-Apr 7. |
| **BDL NCAAB subscription** | ❌ CANCELLED | CBB season over. `balldontlie.py` NCAAB methods will 401 — do not call them. |
| **Yahoo token over-refresh** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 31) | Singleton via `get_yahoo_client()` / `get_resilient_yahoo_client()` — token refreshed once per process, not per request |
| **ProjectionsLoader CSV re-read** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 31) | `@lru_cache(maxsize=1)` on `load_full_board()`; force reload via `POST /admin/fantasy/reload-board` |
| **ADP match rate (was 32%)** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 31) | `_make_player_id` strips suffixes/flips last-name-first; `_apply_adp` adds initial fallback. Expect 80%+ match |
| **Statcast ingestion stub** | ✅ FIXED (Mar 31) | `_update_statcast` now calls `run_daily_ingestion()` via `asyncio.to_thread`; Bayesian updates live |
| **ARCH-001: contracts.py** | ✅ LIVE (Mar 31) | Three immutable Pydantic contracts. Frozen models. ET timestamps. |
| **ARCH-001: job_queue_service** | ✅ VERIFIED | PostgreSQL-backed queue. Table created (v11). INSERT fixed (CAST AS JSONB). Verified picking up jobs. |
| **ARCH-001: /api/fantasy/lineup/async-optimize** | ✅ VERIFIED | Smoke-tested: job submitted, queued, and processed (validation error captured as expected). |
| **ARCH-001: job_queue_processor** | ✅ VERIFIED | Successfully polling and processing from job_queue table. |
| **migrate_v11_job_queue.py** | ✅ COMPLETED | Executed on Railway Mar 31. |

---

## 5. Next Session Roadmap (Claude Code)

Priority order:

1. **ARCH-001 Phase 3: Frontend Integration** — Wire the lineup page to the async backend (see §0 Phase 3 spec above). This is the highest-leverage work right now: Phase 1+2 built the foundation but the frontend still calls blocking endpoints. Phase 3 closes the loop and delivers the <2s load time goal.
   - **Gate:** Gemini confirms Phase 1+2 smoke tests passing on Railway
   - **Execution:** Subagent-driven, Phase 3a → 3b → 3c in order (3a is independent, 3b depends on 3a being stable)

2. **Gemini UI Audit** — Once Phase 3 is implemented, delegate Gemini the read-only audit of `frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/` to identify remaining rough edges (missing loading states, hardcoded strings, broken responsive layout). Claude Code reviews and approves before any frontend code is written.

3. **CBB V9.2 recalibration** (EMAC-068) — Unblocks Apr 7. SNR/integrity scalar stacking correction. Do NOT touch Kelly math before then. Kimi has the spec memo ready (K-12).

4. **Post-Apr 7: BDL MLB expansion** — Execute §2 Phases 1-4 in order. Confirm OddsAPI cancelled before writing any BDL MLB code to avoid calling a cancelled key. Lock IDs 100_012 (mlb_injuries) and 100_013 (mlb_box_scores) reserved.

5. **MLB Betting Module** — After fantasy module is stabilized (Phase 3 complete + BDL wired). `mlb_analysis.py` currently at stub level. Full implementation deferred until data providers are solid.

6. **Historical MCMC validation** — Collect actual H2H matchup outcomes to validate win_probability calibration. Current calibration uses proxy z-scores; empirical validation pending sufficient season data (target: 4 weeks of results).

## 6. Architecture Decisions (Locked)

| Decision | Ruling | Reason |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Yahoo client split-brain | ELIMINATED | Single file: `yahoo_client_resilient.py` |
| Streamlit | RETIRED | Next.js only — never touch `dashboard/` |
| `openclaw_briefs.py` (old) | DELETED | `_improved` is canonical |
| Dashboard refresh strategy | SSE (IMPLEMENTED) | `StreamingResponse` text/event-stream. No sse-starlette dep. |
| Weather provider | OpenWeatherMap (LOCKED) | `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` set |
| Test file location | `tests/` only | No test files in `backend/` subdirs |
| CBB recalibration | BLOCKED until Apr 7 | EMAC-068 — do not touch Kelly math before then |
| SSE keep-alive | `: keep-alive\n\n` comment line | Prevents Railway/nginx from closing idle SSE connections |
| Odds provider — CBB | OddsAPI → CANCEL post-tournament | Battle-tested for CBB; BDL NCAAB subscription already cancelled |
| Odds provider — MLB | BDL GOAT (post-Apr 7) | Unified stats+odds, webhooks, lower cost. Raw OddsAPI callers in mlb_analysis + daily_ingestion are stubs — low-risk swap |
| Stats provider — Statcast | pybaseball (LOCKED) | BDL does not expose xwOBA/barrel%/exit velocity. Do not replace. |
| Stats provider — injuries/box scores | BDL (additive, post-Apr 7) | Supplements Yahoo injury feed which lags by hours |

## 7. Delegation Bundles

### GEMINI CLI (Ops) — ACTIVE TASK

**Deploy ARCH-001 Phase 3 (frontend)**

```
You are Gemini CLI (Ops). ARCH-001 Phase 3 frontend has been built by Claude Code.
Your job is to deploy it to Railway.

Step 1: Trigger redeploy (Phase 3 is frontend-only — no migration needed)
  railway up

Step 2: Smoke-test the async optimize endpoint
  curl -s -X POST https://<app>.railway.app/api/fantasy/lineup/async-optimize \
    -H "X-API-Key: $API_KEY" \
    -d '{"target_date": "2026-04-01"}' | python -m json.tool
  # Should return: {"job_id": "...", "status": "queued", "poll_url": "..."}

Step 3: Smoke-test the valuations endpoint
  curl -s "https://<app>.railway.app/api/fantasy/players/valuations?date=2026-04-01" | python -m json.tool
  # Should return: {"cache_status": "fresh"|"stale"|"empty", ...}

Step 4: Verify the lineup page in the browser
  - Navigate to /fantasy/lineup
  - Confirm page loads without hanging (skeleton → data in <2s)
  - Confirm "Optimize Lineup" button shows progress bar (Queued → Processing → Complete)
  - Confirm "Proj" column appears in batters table (may show — if cache is empty)
  - Confirm cache banner appears if valuations are stale/empty

Step 5: Report results back via HANDOFF.md update

Do NOT edit any .py or .ts files.
```

**Forward-Looking: Gemini UI Audit (READY — activate after Phase 3 implementation)**

Once Claude Code completes ARCH-001 Phase 3 (frontend async wiring), Gemini runs a read-only UI audit:
```
You are Gemini CLI (Ops). ARCH-001 Phase 3 has been implemented by Claude Code.
Your job is a READ-ONLY UI audit — no code changes.

Read all files in:
  frontend/app/(dashboard)/fantasy/
  frontend/components/

Identify and document in reports/GEMINI_UI_AUDIT_2026-04-01.md:
1. Pages/components with no loading states (blank flash on load)
2. Missing error boundaries (components that can crash the whole page)
3. Hardcoded strings that should come from the API (team names, dates, league names)
4. Responsive layout issues visible in the component structure (not runtime)
5. Any remaining blocking API calls that should be async

Format each finding as:
  File: <path>
  Issue: <one-line description>
  Severity: high | medium | low
  Suggested fix: <one-line description for Claude Code to implement>

Do NOT write any code. Do NOT edit any files. Output only to reports/GEMINI_UI_AUDIT_2026-04-01.md.
```
Claude Code reviews the audit output before any frontend changes are actioned.

---

### KIMI CLI (Deep Intelligence Unit) — Standby

> No active coding tasks. Standing responsibilities:
> - If CBB recalibration (EMAC-068) status changes to unblocked, prepare the V9.2 spec memo.
> - ARCH-001 Phase 2 is complete. No further research needed on cache invalidation.
> - Do NOT write to any production code files without an explicit Claude delegation bundle.
>
> Working directory: C:/Users/sfgra/repos/Fixed/cbb-edge
